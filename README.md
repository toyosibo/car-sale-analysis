- **Transmission**: Manual, Automatic, Semi-Automatic
- **Location**: City or region where the car is being sold

### **Objectives**
- Data Cleaning - Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent entries.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Visualizing trends in pricing, mileage, and popular car brands.
- Feature Engineering - Creating new variables to improve insights and potential predictive modeling.
- Statistical Analysis - Identifying key factors that influence car prices.

### **Technologies Used**
#### Python 
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
#### Jupyter Notebook
#### GitHub

### Key Findings
- **Luxury brands** like BMW and Mercedes tend to retain higher resale value.
- **Electric and hybrid cars** are increasing in demand.
- **Manual transmission cars** generally have lower resale value compared to automatic ones.
